V1.2.0.0 Added EC Producer parts to Dark-Side Calculation window. Solar Panels are automatically excluded for power calculations while you have the Dark-Side Calculation window open. When you close the Dark-Side Calculation window Solar Panels are reset to their previous selection state (it remembers if you had them selected or not).
    Added support for ToggleFuelCell mod, which is a tiny mod that changes the Fuel Cells from ModuleResourceConverter to it's own ModuleFuelCell (which is just a wrapped ModuleResourceConverter). When using this mod Fuel Cells are now handled.
	Fixed bug with Alternators and updated to handle negative power alternators (ie. Atomic Age Rockets).
	Changed PartsList to provide a break-up of parts that contain multiple modules that consume or produce EC.
	Corrected EC usage for AmpYears own ION and PPT RCS parts in the editor.
	Implemented colour coded Icons - Green will always appear in the SpaceCenter (will look to see if possible to change the colour based on any of your active vessels EC status in a future release).
	It's fairly rudimentary for this version, happy to look at any feedback anyone has.
	In flight colour will change for the active vessel from Green to Yellow to Red and back again based on EC status.
	Default ReservePower on all Probes and Pods has been boosted from 50 to 80 units. 
	If you have RealismOverhaul installed the default ReservePower on all Probes and Pods is now 2000 units (haven't fully tested game balance, so happy to change this based on feedback).
V1.1.1.0 Fixed bug in reported EC usage for MobileProcessingLab and anything else that uses ModuleScienceLab partmodule. 
V1.1.0.0 Added toggle button next to each part in the PartsList that toggles whether that part is used in EC consumption/production calculations.
    Added Dark-Side Calculations GUI. This allows you to select a Celestial Body, Input a Target Orbit height and AmpYear will calculate the dark-side period in Hours:Mins:Secs and also show you the amount of EC you would
	require to run all vessel parts that consume EC for that period (it Does NOT include any Power Production parts in this calculation).
	Added Mains time and Reserve Time displays to Ampyear Main screen that now show the Time remaining for mains and reserve power batteries based on current stored in each set and EC production and consumption.
	Removed restriction on timewarp - previously if you were running on Reserve Power and tried to time-warp above 50x AmpYear would cancel time-warp. this restriction will no longer apply.
V1.0.5.0 Updated for KSP 1.0.5.
V1.0.4.0 Added Engineers Report in Editor to Provide Information report if Vessel ElectricCharge usage is higher than production.
    Re-added Dummy PartModule to all command pods so that they are considered ReservePower consumers by the Engineers report in the Editor, this will stop the Engineers report reporting that there is no consumer of ReservePower 
	on each vessel.	
	Power Turn feature - Now applies power turn power to ALL reaction wheels on the vessel and consumes additional power turn EC for ALL reaction wheels whilst power turn is active.
	Fixed compatibility with NearFuture Technologies reactors to correctly show power production from reactors.
	Fixed compatibility with NearFuture Solar arrays to correctly show the actual power output in flight.
	Fixed compatibility with Aviation Lights mod to correctly show power usage of lights.
	Fixed compatibility with SCANSat to show correct power usage when scanners are active only.
	Fixed compatibility with TAC LS - Command pods and converter modules now correctly show power usage.
	Under the covers internal code changes to reflect other mods for EC usage (going forward AmpYear does not need to be updated every time a mod that it tracks for EC is updated). It should also now support backwards and forwards compatibility
	of all supported mods (unless the authors of those mods made drastic changes, which can still occur, but less frequently than before).
V1.0.3.0 Updated to support NFE V0.5.3 and RemoteTech 1.6.8
V1.0.2.0 Exclude MechJeb parts from having reserve power by default.    
    Changed SAS usage to include any reaction wheel usage that is not via standard SAS (eg. Mechjeb). 
    Added REPOSoftTech Agency config.  
    Updated to support the following versions of other mods to report their EC usage correctly:   
        AntennaRange 1.10.1, KAS 0.5.4, NFE 0.5.1, NFS 0.5.21, RemoteTech 1.6.7, SCANSat 14.1, TeleMachus 1.4.30        
V1.0.1.0 GUI Fixes and Enhancements  
    Fixed Toolbar/AppLauncher Icon issue.  
     GUI Improvements.  
     Added Part List screen to the Flight GUI. So you can now see EC  consumption and production per part in Flight (as well as SPH/VAB as you  could before).  
     Support latest SCANSat V14.0. if you use SCANSat you will have to update it to this version for it to work with AmpYear.  
V1.00 Time for full release.  Version bumped to 1.0.0.0
    Fixes to new 4-way ION RCS, it now works. Fixed attach points for 4-way ION RCS. Fixed texture for 4-way ION RCS.
